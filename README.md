Disclaimer: I do not own this implementation. This is ITU's reference
implementation, the original zip archive can be downloaded
[here](http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.862/en). 

I've added a Makefile for easy compilation. There are no dependencies other
than the standard C library. Verification files can be also be found in the
original archive.
